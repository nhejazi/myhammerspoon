# my Hammerspoon configuration

[![MIT license](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-brightgreen.svg)](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

My configuration files for the OS X management tool
[Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/).

## Directions/Roadmap
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nhejazi/myhammerspoon.git ~/.hammerspoon
```

__N.B.__, setting up this configuration assumes that
[Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) has already been installed on the
Mac OS X machine. This is easily done (for example) using [Homebrew
Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/) via `brew cask install hammerspoon`.

## Directions/Roadmap
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nhejazi/myhammerspoon.git ~/.hammerspoon
```

__N.B.__, make sure that [Hammerspoon](http://www.hammerspoon.org/) has already
been installed on the macOS machine before attempting to use this configuration.
This is easily done, for example, using [Homebrew
Cask](https://caskroom.github.io/) via `brew cask install hammerspoon`.
